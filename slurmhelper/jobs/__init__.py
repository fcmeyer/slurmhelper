"""This python submodule contains helper classes and functions for dealing with jobs.
In this package, a "job" is defined as a single submissible script, which can be part of
a broader "package" or array of jobs, or not. For the purposes of this package, here I
consider a specific "job" calculation of a given neuroimaging derivative, for a given neuroimaging run,
of a given task, of a given session, of a given subject. Others may choose to parcellate "jobs" more or
less grossly.
